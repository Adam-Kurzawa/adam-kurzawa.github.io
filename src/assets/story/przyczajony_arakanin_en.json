    "description": "A rich playboy, Michał Jan Podhorodecki, receives a long-undeserved promotion to Commander of the 43rd Battle Group of the 3rd Constellation, United Republic of Poland Space Fleet. To highlight his complete lack of merit in military service, he is assigned a Critically Important Mission in the absolute back end of the Galaxy. As an added bonus — and to his considerable surprise — he quickly discovers he is not exactly welcome aboard his new drednought, the ORP Prophet, and the freshly assembled crew requires more babysitting than command. And Michał? He neither wants to, nor knows how to be a babysitter. Just when he thinks he can breeze through the mission and win over the crew with mead and parties, a mysterious generation ship arrives from a nearby star system—belonging to ancient, unknown aliens.",
